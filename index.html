<h1> Welcome to Jumpstart Pittsburgh</h1>
<p class="a"> According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should
be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat
little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway.
Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 -
“INTRO TO BARRY” INT. BENSON HOUSE - DAY ANGLE ON: Sneakers on the ground.

yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black
and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror.
BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then
goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into
his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles.
Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like
deodorant. CUT TO: INT. BENSON HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Barry’s

 Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, Son. And a perfect report card, all B’s. J
 ANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry
  re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She pick
  s it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry
  zips off. BARRY Bye! JANET BENSON Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! CU
